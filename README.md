# AuthBee

AuthBee is a NPM package to implement authentication in your JavaScript project. If you are using JWT in your project, this is the best option for you since this tracks expirationDate with the help of localStorage and logouts the usert if token is expired.

## Features

* Token Verification
* Automatic Logout when token expires

## How to use

You can simply import and call ``` login, logout, verify and getData``` functions in your application with respective parameters. But I highly encourage you to refer documentation [here](https://npmjs.com/authbee).  Also, I encourage you to refer example, which you'll be able to gain more understanding about the functions.

## Documentation

Please see the documentation [here](https://npmjs.com/authbee).

The source code of the website can be found [here](https://github.com/shakyapeiris/AuthBee/tree/main/example). Contributions are welcome!

## Testing

You can test the code of AuthBee package using jest which is already implemented in __tests__ folder.
