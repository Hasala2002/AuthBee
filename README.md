# AuthBee

AuthBee is a NPM package to implement authentication in your JavaScript project. If you are using JWT in your project, this is the best option for you since this tracks expirationDate with the help of localStorage and logouts the usert if token is expired.

## Features

* Token Verification
* Automatic Logout when token expires

## How to use

You can simply import and call ``` login, logout, verify and getData``` functions in your application with respective parameters. But I highly encourage you to refer documentation [here](https://npmjs.com/authbee)

## Documentation

Please see the documentation [here](https://npmjs.com/authbee).

The source code of the website can be found [here](https://github.com/shakyapeiris/AuthBee/tree/main/example). Contributions are welcome!

## Testing
